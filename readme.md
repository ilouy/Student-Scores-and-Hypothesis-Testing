# Student Scores and Hypothesis Testing

This is a solution for one of the assigned problems in the Bayesian Computational Statistics class.

### Description

StudentPerformance.csv contains test scores of high school students, broken down by three subjects: reading, writing, and mathematics. In addition to scores, you have information about the individual students. Specifically: gender, race/ethnicity, test preparation, and parental level of education.

It is very common to take a dataset like this one, set up several hypothesis tests, and assess where statistically significant differences lie. For this assignment, you will instead perform Bayesian analysis for as many tests as you can think to do for this dataset. Because there are many dimensions of breakdown, you should expect to do several. To assist you in thinking up which hypothesis tests to conduct, imagine a client who wishes to understand this dataset, such as a principal at a high school aiming to understand:

- Which students struggle in what area(s)?
- Which students should be targeted for test preparation?

Because you aim for actionable conclusions, you need to give some thought to whether the changes are large enough to warrant action. How could you use credibility intervals to assess this?

Write up your analysis in a detailed report. The report should contain:

- What conclusions can you draw, if any, from the work youâ€™ve done?
- Whether or not these methods are well-suited to this situation.
- What concerns you have, if any, regarding inferring from such a small sample of years.
- A thorough explanation of how the model works and the extent to which we should "trust" the findings.

Your write-up should be written for a general audience-both for those who know little mathematics and for those familiar with Bayesian inference. The write-up should be well-organized and provide several visual aids. Do your best to anticipate questions they may have in your write-up.

Your deliverables will be:

- A write-up explaining the work done and your findings.
- R script(s) containing your computations. (Python or Excel is also acceptable.)
